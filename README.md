# Tank Trouble

This is a basic clone of the game [Tank Trouble](http://www.tanktrouble.com/) which I developed with three of my friends in 2014.  

As part of our Object Oriented Programming course, we were recommended to create some form of group project, though it was entirely optional and didn't count towards our grade.  We decided that it would be a fun and useful thing to do anyway, so we jointly put this together.

### Description

Tank Trouble is a 2 player game where each player aims to shoot the opponent's tank without getting shot themselves.  You each navigate round a procedurally generated maze, firing up to 5 bullets at a time - which can bounce off walls, so watch out round corners!  Be warned, you can shoot yourself too, so take care!  Bullets will expire 15s after being fired, so be careful not to use all your bullets too quickly.

### Known Issues and Missing Features

As this was a learning project for us as much as anything else, there are unsurprisingly a few issues with the game.  First, and perhaps most important, we never actually display the score anywhere, though it is saved in the code.  The other main issue which has been identified is that occasionally if you fire a bullet at a corner at just the right angle, it will enter the wall.  If you find any other bugs, please do let us know.  

Otherwise, enjoy!
