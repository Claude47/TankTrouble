This is a basic clone of the game [Tank Trouble](http://www.tanktrouble.com/) which I developed with three of my friends in 2014.  As part of our Object Oriented Programming course, we were recommended to create some form of group project, though it was entirely optional and didn't count towards our grade.  We decided it would be a fun and useful thing to do, so we worked as a group to put this together.
